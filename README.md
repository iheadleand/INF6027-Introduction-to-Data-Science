The following repository presents the datasets used and code produced for the INF6027 Introduction to Data Science Coursework. 

## Introduction and Research Questions
The project aimed to explore how a songs audio and metadata features can be used to predict a songs popularity using information in the publically available MusicOSet dataset with research questions:__ 
RQ1: What song audio and metadata features show significant association with song popularity 
RQ2: To what extent can multivariable linear regression be used to accurately predict song popularity from song audio and metadata features

The work was undertaken in R studio intially exploring how the different song features singificantly associated with song popularity. A multivariable linear regression model was then developed using selected features to evaluate how the song features could be used to predict song popularity.
